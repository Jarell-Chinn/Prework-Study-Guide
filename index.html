        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> The link element creates a connection to an external file.</li>
          <li> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) gives the content structure.</li>
          <li> The Head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li> The Body element represents the visible content shown to the user. (which is where this code is)</li>
          <li> Semantic HTML elements- an element that describes its content and the role it plays on the webpage.</li>
          <li> Opening and closing tags tell the browser how to treat the content between them. </li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) give the content style.</li>
          <li> Selector defines the element or attributes to which rules, or declarations, will apply. </li>
          <li> Declarations contain two important components 1. The CSS property we want to apply 2. The value of the property.</li>
          <li> Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li> The Padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li> You can combine two selectors by using  a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Meaning you don't have to repeat code.</li>
          <li> The * symbol declares that all of the elements on the page will have the style properties.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Git is software on a computer that tracks changes you make to your code. This is connected to Github.</li>
          <li> Github is a cloud-based service that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate code.</li>
          <li> SSH keys are an access credential for the secure shell (SSH) that allows developers to interface with remote services such as Github without having to constantly retype login information.</li>
          <li> git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li> git checkout: switches to another branch and check it out into your working directory.</li>
          <li> git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li> git commit -m "[descriptive message]": commits your staged content as a new commit snapshot.</li>
          <li> if you ever want a list of your branches use "git branch."</li>
          <li> git log: shows all commits in the branch's history.</li>
          <li> git merge [branch]: merges the specified branch's history into the current one.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) handles logic and allows users to interact with a website.</li>
          <li> Variables- containers that store values, you can do this by declaring with the "let" keyword followed by the name you give to the variable.</li>
          <li> The String variable is a sequence of text. To signify that a value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li> The Number variable does NOT have quotes around them they are simply the number you</li>
          <li> The Boolean variable is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quotation marks.</li>
          <li> The Array variable is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li> The Object variable can be anything. Everything is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
          <li> Same with CSS you can add comments to code and just like CSS the browser will ignore text marked as comments.</li>
          <li> An Operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values or variables. This includes basic symbols like +,-,*,/</li>
          <li> Another Operator that can be used is called "strict equality" symboled by "===" This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns a true/false result.</li>
          <li> "!==" is a "does not equal" or a "not" This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a "true" into a "false", and many things like that. when it is used alongside the equality Operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are NOT equal.</li>
          <li> Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very prevalent form of conditionals is the if.. else statement.</li>
          <li> Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. Remember to use these so you don't have to repeatedly write the same code.</li>
          <li> Events are the interactivity on a website that requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser and run code in response.</li>
          <li> The .js file extension indicates that the file is a JavaScript file.</li>
