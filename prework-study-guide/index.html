        <ul>
          <li> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) gives the content style.</li>
          <li> Selector defines the element or attributes to which rules, or declarations, will apply. </li>
          <li> Declarations contain two important components 1. The CSS property we want to apply 2. The value of the property.</li>
          <li> Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li> Padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li> You can combine two selectors by using  a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Meaning you dont have to repeat code.</li>
          <li> The * symbol declares that all of the elements on the page will have the style properties.</li>
