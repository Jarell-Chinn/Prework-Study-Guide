Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I want to have a better understanding on they keywords in coding and the overall coding process.
- This Study Guide will help me succeed during my bootcamp.
- I will be placing and updating notes throughout the bootcamp here to help keep them organized and to see how far I've come to keep myself motivated to continue learning.
- I have learned the foundations of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript! And if you can read this, that means I learned how to deploy it as well!
